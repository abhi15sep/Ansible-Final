## Mastering Ansible Repo (Retired)

This repository is now considered legacy and out of date.  The course relating to this repository has recently been updated to a new version known as Dive Into Ansible.  

The new course code repository is available at - https://github.com/spurin/diveintoansible

The new lab setup (where Ansible runs from your browser) is available at - https://github.com/spurin/diveintoansible-lab

*Updates*

- All of the course, has been updated to the very latest version of Ansible, which at this time is 2.10

- Python 3, is used as standard throughout the course
 
- The lab experience has been enhanced significantly. We've moved away from the Virtualbox based Virtual Machines and the lab runs entirely as containers in Docker! The lab can be launched with a single command and all systems, are now also accessible from your web browser!
 
- Hands on exercises
 
- Quizzes
 
- A playbook project where we launch a website with a special easter egg, an Ansible themed game known as 'Playbook Stacker'
 
- Improved Audio & Visuals

At present the course is available on Udemy at [https://www.udemy.com/course/diveintoansible](https://www.udemy.com/course/diveintoansible/?referralCode=28BBB7A1DCCD01BBA51F) and will be published by Packt on other platforms like O'Reilly towards the end of December 2020 or January 2021.

Thanks for all your previous support and I hope you very much enjoy the new version.  If you're interested, I also welcome all LinkedIn connections where I will be sending out future updates - https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesspurin
